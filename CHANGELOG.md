# Version History

## Intro

The version history is motivated by https://semver.org/ and https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ .

NOTE: This project went from non-standard versioning to semver at some point.

## Structure

Types of changes that can be seen in the changelog

```
Added: for new features/functionality.
Changed: for changes in existing features/functionality.
Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features. Removed in the
Removed: for now removed features.
Fixed: for any bug fixes.
Security: in case of vulnerabilities.
```

## How deprecation of functionality is handled?

tl;dr 1 minor release stating that the functionality is going to be deprecated. Then in the next major - removed.

```
Deprecating existing functionality is a normal part of software development and
is often required to make forward progress.

When you deprecate part of your public API, you should do two things:

(1) update your documentation to let users know about the change,
(2) issue a new minor release with the deprecation in place.
Before you completely remove the functionality in a new major
release there should be at least one minor release
that contains the deprecation so that users can smoothly transition to the new API
```

As per https://semver.org/ .

As per rule-of-thumb, moving the project forward is very important,
but providing stability is the most important thing to anyone using `goenv`.

Introducing breaking changes under a feature flag can be ok in some cases where new functionality needs user feedback before being introduced in next major release.

### Added

- Add golang installations of 1.12.1. and 1.11.6 ; Ref: https://github.com/go-nv/goenv/pull/71

## 2.0.0beta6

### Added

- Add management of env variable `GOROOT` that can be disabled with env var `GOENV_DISABLE_GOROOT=1`,
  when calling `goenv-sh-rehash` (`goenv rehash` when `eval $(goenv init -)` was previously executed).
  It does not attempt to manage when version is `system`.
  ; Ref: https://github.com/go-nv/goenv/pull/70
- Add management of env variable `GOPATH` that can be disabled with env var `GOENV_DISABLE_GOPATH=1`,
  when calling `goenv-sh-rehash` (`goenv rehash` when `eval $(goenv init -)` was previously executed).
  It does not attempt to manage when version is `system`.
  ; Ref: https://github.com/go-nv/goenv/pull/70
- Add configurable managed `GOPATH` prefix for `goenv-sh-rehash`
  (`goenv rehash` when `eval $(goenv init -)` was previously executed).
  Configured via `GOENV_GOPATH_PREFIX=<your prefix>`.
  E.g `GOENV_GOPATH_PREFIX=/tmp`.
  Default managed `GOPATH` is `$HOME/go`.
  ; Ref: https://github.com/go-nv/goenv/pull/70
- Add `--only-manage-paths` option to `goenv-sh-rehash` (`goenv rehash` when `eval $(goenv init -)` was previously executed) to skip calling `goenv-rehash` and update shims.
  Instead it only updates managed `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` env variables.
  It does not attempt to manage when version is `system`.
  ; Ref: https://github.com/go-nv/goenv/pull/70

### Changed

- Changed `goenv`'s bootstrap (`eval $(goenv init -)`) now to call `goenv-sh-rehash --only-manage-paths`.
  This means that it'll export and manage `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` env vars.
  It does not attempt to manage when version is `system`.
  ; Ref: https://github.com/go-nv/goenv/pull/70
- Changed `goenv-exec` now to set `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables before
  executing specified cmd and args. Can be disable via `GOENV_DISABLE_GOPATH=1` and `GOENV_DISABLE_GOROOT=1`.
  `GOPATH` can be configured with `GOENV_GOPATH_PREFIX`. E.g `GOENV_GOPATH_PREFIX=/tmp/goenv`.
  Default managed `GOPATH` is `$HOME/go`.
